### 3. Add Your Token

Create a `token.txt` file and paste your **Bearer Token** inside. This token is required for the bot to interact with your account.

```bash
nano token.txt
```

Paste your token and save the file.

### 4. (Optional) Add a Proxy

If you'd like to run the bot behind a proxy (for privacy or geo-location reasons), create a `proxy.txt` file:

```bash
nano proxy.txt
```

Add your proxy in this format:

```
http://username:password@host:port
```

Leave the file empty if you're not using a proxy.

## ▶️ Run the Bot

Once everything is configured, you can start the bot using:

```bash
npm start

You should see logs in your terminal indicating that the bot is running and mining operations have started.
